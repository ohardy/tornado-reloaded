This repository contain a fork of Tornado who contains :
- Support for mongodb as database
- Support for redis as cache

- Common UI methods
- Async auth before call handler and async prepare call
- Auth handlers
- A lot of various, unused and bugy methods and code

For mongodb, this fork require my fork of APYmongo (https://github.com/ohardy/APyMongo)

After this fork is installed, go in empty folder and do:

    tornado init
    
And after just do:

    tornado runserver local
    
Open your browser on http://127.0.0.1:8888 and it's just work :)
